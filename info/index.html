				<h1>Rebuilding the MineFrost Network</h1>
				<p>To whom it may concern, <br />
        <br />The inherent purpose of this project is to restore MineFrost’s legacy. MineFrost’s incredibly rich history and its name, has been tainted by several recent years of unsuccessful attempts at restoring its former spirit. At a certain point, I adopted other priorities in life. As a result, desperate measures were taken in hopes of increasing its longevity from the fear of letting the server go, which ironically only accelerated its perishment altogether.
<br />
				As the original founder of the MineFrost network, I am well aware of the incredible impact this community has had on everyone who has ever been a part of it. Many players, myself included, have literally grown up alongside the server. Acknowledging this has sparked a new wave of  passion into rebooting this community, and once again creating a lighthearted environment, where anyone—no matter their background—can log on and share their enjoyment of the game with others. For me it was never about Minecraft itself, my satisfaction and fulfillment came from creating and managing an organization, which created something that people wanted and enjoyed. My expertise from running a server for so long does not translate into being a good player, but it manifests in knowing how to manage people, being able to create and implement a strategy for starting and maintaining a server efficiently—whether at its humble inception or at a larger scale.  <br /> <br /><i>For more information please read our <a href="#"> <b>Letter of Intent</b></a>.</i></b> <br /> <br /> If you're interested in our journey to come, and would like to get information along the way, please subscribe to our newsletter below.</p>
